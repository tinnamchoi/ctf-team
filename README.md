### DuckCTF

This was my first CTF so I didn't document it well and it's not on CTFTime so there's not much to see here

### [SHELLCTF 2022](https://ctftime.org/event/1604)

Good beginner-friendly challenges, but the challenge categories are often inaccurate or even misleading. Diligence shown in reducing downtime though.

### [nullcon Goa HackIM CTF 2022](https://ctftime.org/event/1718)

Could not access any challenges at all after doing the sanity check so I just gave up on this. I think T3N4CI0US cursed this one. 

Didn't bother making a separate repo for obvious reasons.
